# Build From Source on MacOS

## Prerequisites

In order to compile PcapPlusPlus on MacOS please make sure you have the following components installed:

1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) which contains all prerequisites required for PcapPlusPlus including gcc/g++ compiler and libpcap with all relevant header files
2. PcapPlusPlus is available for both **Intel** and **Apple Silicon** processors. To cross-compile for a different architecture you can use the `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` option, see more details below
3. **OPTIONAL** - install [Zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) if you wish to enable [PCAPNG streaming compression support](../features#readingwriting-pcapng-files-with-compression):
   ```shell
   brew install zstd
   ```

## Build

Assuming you want to build PcapPlusPlus into a `build` directory:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build
```

And then initiate the build in one of two ways:

- Using CMake:
  ```shell
  cmake --build build
  ```
- Using `make`:
  ```shell
  cd build
  make
  ```

This process will build the following artifacts:

- PcapPlusPlus libs:
  - `build/Common++/libCommon++.a`
  - `build/Packet++/libPacket++.a`
  - `build/Pcap++/libPcap++.a`
- PcapPlusPlus examples binaries under `build/examples_bin`
- PcapPlusPlus tests:
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>/Tests/Packet++Test/Bin/Packet++Test`
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>/Tests/Pcap++Test/Bin/Pcap++Test`

The following configuration options are available (on top of CMake's built-in options):

| Option                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=<ON/OFF>`**             | Build PcapPlusPlus examples (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                             |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TESTS=<ON/OFF>`**                | Build PcapPlusPlus tests (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                                |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TUTORIALS=<ON/OFF>`**            | Build PcapPlusPlus tutorials. This option is only available if `DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`. The tutorials binaries will be under `build/tutorials_bin` (default value is `OFF`) |
| **`-DPCAPPP_INSTALL=<ON/OFF>`**                    | Install PcapPlusPlus (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                                    |
| **`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=<ON/OFF>`**                 | Build shared libs (default value is `OFF`)                                                                                                                                      |
| **`-DLIGHT_PCAPNG_ZSTD=<ON/OFF>`**                 | Build with Zstd to enable [PCAPNG streaming compression support](../features#readingwriting-pcapng-files-with-compression) (default value is `OFF`)                             |
| **`-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=<x86_64,arm64>`**     | Build for either Intel (x86_64) or Apple Silicon (arm64) architecture. If not provided, the default is the machine's architecture                                               |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_PCAPPP=<ON/OFF>`**               | Build the Pcap++ library (default value is `ON`). Turning it off will only build Common++ and Packet++ and avoid third-party dependencies such as libpcap or WinPcap/Npcap      |
| **`-DPCAPPP_LOG_LEVEL=<0/1/2/3>`**                 | Set compile time log level: Off (`0`), Error (`1`), Info (`2`), Debug (`1`) (Default value is `Debug`)                                                                          |

## Installation

After the build is complete you can run the installation script which will copy the libraries, header files and examples into the installation directories:

```shell
sudo cmake --install .
```

If you want to install on a non-default directory you can use this command:

```shell
DESTDIR=<DIR> cmake --install build --prefix "/"
```

## Running tests

PcapPlusPlus contains a set of test-cases you can run to make sure that everything works correctly on your system. [This guide](../tests) contains detailed instructions on how to run them.
