# Build From Source for Android

## Prerequisites

In order to build PcapPlusPlus for Android please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) should be installed
2. Pre-compiled `libpcap` library for Android + header files which can be downloaded from [the `libpcap-android` GitHub repo](https://github.com/seladb/libpcap-android) (for Android API versions 21-30)

## Build

In order to build for Android a few parameters are needed:

- The path of Android NDK. Let's assume it's stored in `ANDROID_NDK`
- Android API version - must be between 21 and 30. Let's assume it's stored in `API_VERSIOM`
- Target architecture which accepts the following values: `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, `x86_64`. Let's assume it's stored in `ANDROID_ABI`
- The path of `libpcap` compiled for Android. Let's assume it's stored in `LIBPCAP_DIR`

Assuming you want to build PcapPlusPlus into a `build` directory:

```shell
cmake \
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="${ANDROID_NDK}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
-DANDROID_PLATFORM="${API_VERSION}" \
-DANDROID_ABI="${ABI}" \
-DPCAP_LIBRARY="${LIBPCAP_DIR}/${ABI}/${API_VERSION}/libpcap.a" \
-DPCAP_INCLUDE_DIR="${LIBPCAP_DIR}/include/" \
-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
-DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
-S . -B build
```

:::tip NOTE

`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` and `-DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF` are not mandatory, but building PcapPlusPlus tests and examples for Android usually doesn't make sense.

:::

And then initiate the build in one of two ways:

- Using CMake:
  ```shell
  cmake --build build
  ```
- Using `make`:
  ```shell
  cd build
  make
  ```

This process will build the PcapPlusPlus libs:

- `build/Common++/libCommon++.a`
- `build/Packet++/libPacket++.a`
- `build/Pcap++/libPcap++.a`

The following configuration options are available (on top of CMake's built-in options):

## Installation

When building for Android the build machine (host) is usually different from the target device (target), so you may want to gather the lib and header files in a directory in the host instead of installing it on it.
You can use the following command in order to achieve this:

```shell
DESTDIR=<DIR> cmake --install build --prefix "/"
```

## Do I need a rooted device in order to use PcapPlusPlus in my Android app?

import APIDocsLink from '@site/src/components/APIDocsLink';

The quick answer is no. A lot of PcapPlusPlus functionality will work on any device and any app. However, on non-rooted devices some of the features may not work. The main reason is that non-rooted devices do not allow access to the device's network interfaces and configuration. That means that capturing live network traffic using <APIDocsLink relativePath="/classpcpp_1_1_pcap_live_device.html">`PcapLiveDevice`</APIDocsLink> may not work, as well as opening raw sockets with <APIDocsLink relativePath="/classpcpp_1_1_raw_socket_device.html">`RawSocketDevice`</APIDocsLink>. You may also need your app to request [additional permissions to read and write files](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage) in order to read and write pcap/pcapng files.

But other than that, most of the features should work including parsing and analyzing of network packets and the [various protocols](../features#supported-network-protocols) supported by PcapPlusPlus, which is what [ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus) demonstrates.

If you do have a rooted device most of PcapPlusPlus features should work. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/issues) if something is not working as expected.

## Using PcapPlusPlus in my app

PcapPlusPlus is a native C++ library so in order to use it in an Android app you need to get familiar with [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) which is the toolset for using native code in Android apps.

[ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus) is a good way to get started because it provides a very simple yet end-to-end example of writing PcapPlusPlus code and integrating it with the app. Here are a few links to parts in the code you might find interesting:

- [`PacketAnalyzer.cpp`](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus/blob/master/app/src/main/cpp/PacketAnalyzer.cpp) - the C++ code that uses PcapPlusPlus. It exposes 2 [JNI](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-jni) methods that are used within the app
- [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus/blob/master/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt) - a CMake file to build the native code
- [`toyvpn/pcapplusplus`](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/pcapplusplus/toyvpn/pcapplusplus) - Kotlin files that use the native JNI methods

If you want to learn more we strongly recommend going over [ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus's `README.md`](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus/blob/master/README.md) file as it contains very detail information of how PcapPlusPlus can be used in a real Android app.
