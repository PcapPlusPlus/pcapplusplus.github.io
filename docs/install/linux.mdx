# Build From Source on Linux

## Prerequisites

In order to compile PcapPlusPlus on Linux please make sure you have the following components installed:

1. **libpcap developers pack** - contains the libpcap library PcapPlusPlus is linking with and relevant the header files. You can download it from [http://www.tcpdump.org/#latest-release](http://www.tcpdump.org/#latest-release) or through the standard Linux package managers such as `apt-get` or `yum`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
   ```

   or:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install libpcap-devel
   ```

2. **OPTIONAL** - download and install [Zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/latest) if you wish to enable [PCAPNG streaming compression support](../features#readingwriting-pcapng-files-with-compression)

## Build

Assuming you want to build PcapPlusPlus into a `build` directory:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build
```

And then initiate the build in one of two ways:

- Using CMake:
  ```shell
  cmake --build build
  ```
- Using `make`:
  ```shell
  cd build
  make
  ```

This process will build the following artifacts:

- PcapPlusPlus libs:
  - `build/Common++/libCommon++.a`
  - `build/Packet++/libPacket++.a`
  - `build/Pcap++/libPcap++.a`
- PcapPlusPlus examples binaries under `build/examples_bin`
- PcapPlusPlus tests:
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>/Tests/Packet++Test/Bin/Packet++Test`
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>/Tests/Pcap++Test/Bin/Pcap++Test`

The following configuration options are available (on top of CMake's built-in options):

| Option                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TUTORIALS=<ON/OFF>`**            | Build PcapPlusPlus tutorials. This option is only available if `DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`. The tutorials binaries will be under `build/tutorials_bin` (default value is `OFF`)                                                                            |

| **`-DPCAPPP_USE_DPDK=<ON/OFF>`**                   | Setup PcapPlusPlus with DPDK (default value is `OFF`). When this option is used CMake will look for an installed version of DPDK on the build machine (usually under `/usr/local`). If DPDK is installed in a different directory please use `-DDPDK_ROOT` |
| **`-DPCAPPP_USE_DPDK_KNI=<ON/OFF>`**               | Setup PcapPlusPlus with DPDK and KNI (default value is `OFF`). DPDK KNI is being deprecated in newer DPDK versions (>= 22.11), however PcapPlusPlus can still support it if using older DPDK versions when this option is used                             |
| **`-DDPDK_ROOT=<DIR>`**                            | When setting up PcapPlusPlus with DPDK and DPDK is not installed in the defualt directory (usually under `/usr/local`) use this option to indicate DPDK installation directory                                                                             |
| **`-DPCAPPP_USE_PF_RING=<ON/OFF>`**                | Setup PcapPlusplus with PF_RING (default value is `OFF`). When this option is used CMake will look for an installed version of PF_RING on the build machine (usually under `/usr/local`). If PF_RING is not installed please use `-DPF_RING_ROOT`          |
| **`-DPF_RING_ROOT=<DIR>`**                         | When setting up PcapPlusPlus with PF_RING and PF_RING is not installed on the machine use this option to indicate the PF_RING directory (for example `/PF_RING`)                                                                                           |
| **`-DPCAPPP_USE_XDP=<ON/OFF>`**                    | Setup PcapPlusPlus with AF_XDP (default value is `OFF`). When this option is used CMake will look for an installed version of `libbpf` on the build machine                                                                                                |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_PCAPPP=<ON/OFF>`**               | Build the Pcap++ library (default value is `ON`). Turning it off will only build Common++ and Packet++ and avoid third-party dependencies such as libpcap or WinPcap/Npcap                                                                                 |
| **`-DPCAPPP_LOG_LEVEL=<0/1/2/3>`**                 | Set compile time log level: Off (`0`), Error (`1`), Info (`2`), Debug (`1`) (Default value is `Debug`)                                                                                                                                                     |

## Installation

After the build is complete you can run the installation script which will copy the libraries, header files and examples into the installation directories:

```shell
sudo cmake --install .
```

If you want to install on a non-default directory you can use this command:

```shell
DESTDIR=<DIR> cmake --install build --prefix "/"
```

## Running tests

PcapPlusPlus contains a set of test-cases you can run to make sure that everything works correctly on your system. [This guide](../tests) contains detailed instructions on how to run them.

## Cross-compilation or build for different architectures

CMake supports cross compilation out-of-the-box so there is no need for any additional support in PcapPlusPlus.

Please refer to this page that provides information on how to cross compile with CMake: [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Cross%20Compiling%20With%20CMake.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Cross%20Compiling%20With%20CMake.html)
