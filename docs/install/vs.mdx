# Build From Source on Windows - Visual Studio

Please visit the [supported platforms page](../platforms) to see the Visual Studio versions currently supported in PcapPlusPlus.

## Prerequisites

In order to build PcapPlusPlus on Windows with Visual Studio you need the following components:

1. A [supported version](../platforms) of Microsoft Visual Studio
2. `CMake` which can be installed from: [https://cmake.org/install/](https://cmake.org/install/) or with `pacman` if using MSYS2: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake`
3. Download and install [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/) **OR** [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) on your system
   :::tip Note for Npcap:
   If you install **Npcap** please check the `Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatilbility mode` option during installation:

   ![Npcap-WinPcap compatilibitly](/img/install/Npcap_compatibility_mode.png)
   :::

4. [WinPcap developer's pack](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm) **OR** [Npcap SDK](https://nmap.org/npcap/guide/npcap-devguide.html) - containing the wpcap library PcapPlusPlus is linking with plus relevant `h` files.
   1. WinPcap developer's pack can be downloaded from here: [https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm)
   2. Npcap SDK can be downloaded from here: [https://nmap.org/npcap/#download](https://nmap.org/npcap/#download)
5. In some cases you also need to download and install:
   1. [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) for your version of Visual Studio
   2. [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=14632)
6. OPTIONAL - download [Zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/latest) libraries if you wish to enable [PCAPNG streaming compression support](../features#readingwriting-pcapng-files-with-compression)

## Build

Assuming you want to build PcapPlusPlus into a `build` directory:

```shell
cmake -DPCAP_ROOT=<NpcapSDK_or_WinPcapDevPack_Directory> -S . -B build
```

You can use the following CMake options to determine specific parameters:

- To build for a specific (non-default) version of Visual Studio you can use the `-G` option, for example `-G "Visual Studio 16 2019"` will builf for VS 2019
- To build for a specific platform you can use the `-A` option, for example: `-A x64` or `-A Win32`

This will create a VS Solution file in the build directory: `build\PcapPlusPlus.sln` and multiple VS project files `.vcxproj`.

This solution file contains all the projects required to build the PcapPlusPlus libraries, examples, and tests. In this solution you'll find the `ALL_BUILD`
project that builds everything.

There are multiple options to build PcapPlusPlus:

- Use CMake and choose the configuration:
  ```shell
  cmake --build build --config Release
  ```
- Open Visual Studio, choose platform and configuration and build the `ALL_BUILD` project
- Use `MSBuild` and choose the platform and configuration, for example:
  ```shell
  msbuild PcapPlusPlus.sln -target:ALL_BUILD /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
  ```

After a successful build the following artifacts will be created:

- PcapPlusPlus libs:
  - `build\Common++\<Debug/Release>\libCommon++.a`
  - `build\Packet++\<Debug/Release>\libPacket++.a`
  - `build\Pcap++\<Debug/Release>\libPcap++.a`
- PcapPlusPlus examples binaries under `build\examples_bin\<Debug/Release>`
- PcapPlusPlus tests:
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>\Tests\Packet++Test\Bin\Packet++Test.exe`
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>\Tests\Pcap++Test\Bin\Pcap++Test.exe`

The following configuration options are available (on top of CMake's built-in options):

| Option                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`-DPCAP_ROOT=<DIR>`**                            | Npcap SDK or WinPcap developer pack directory (mandatory option)                                                                                                                |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=<ON/OFF>`**             | Build PcapPlusPlus examples (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                             |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TESTS=<ON/OFF>`**                | Build PcapPlusPlus tests (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                                |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TUTORIALS=<ON/OFF>`**            | Build PcapPlusPlus tutorials. This option is only available if `DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`. The tutorials binaries will be under `build\tutorials_bin` (default value is `OFF`) |
| **`-DPCAPPP_INSTALL=<ON/OFF>`**                    | Install PcapPlusPlus (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                                    |
| **`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=<ON/OFF>`**                 | Build shared libs (default value is `OFF`)                                                                                                                                      |
| **`-DPCAPPP_ENABLE_PCAP_IMMEDIATE_MODE=<ON/OFF>`** | Enable pcap immediate mode, available only in Npcap (default value is `OFF`)                                                                                                    |

| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_PCAPPP=<ON/OFF>`**               | Build the Pcap++ library (default value is `ON`). Turning it off will only build Common++ and Packet++ and avoid third-party dependencies such as libpcap or WinPcap/Npcap      |

## Installation

Windows doesn't have a default install directory, but you may want to see all libs, header files and examples under one directory (which is not the `build` directory).
Here is how to acheive that:

```shell
set DESTDIR=<DIR>
cmake --install build --prefix "/"
```

## Running tests

PcapPlusPlus contains a set of test-cases you can run to make sure that everything works correctly on your system. [This guide](../tests) contains detailed instructions on how to run them.
