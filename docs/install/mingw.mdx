# Build From Source on Windows - MinGW-w64

## Prerequisites

In order to compile PcapPlusPlus on Windows using MinGW-w64 you need the following components:

1. `CMake` which can be installed from: [https://cmake.org/install/](https://cmake.org/install/) or with `pacman` if using MSYS2: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake`
2. Download and run MinGW-w64 installer from here: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
3. Make sure that MinGW-w64 `bin` directory is in your `PATH` environment variable, for example:
   ```shell
   PATH=%PATH%;C:\mingw-w64\i686-8.1.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0\mingw32\bin
   ```
4. Download and install [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/) **OR** [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) on your system
   :::tip Note for Npcap:
   If you install **Npcap** please check the `Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatilbility mode` option during installation:

   ![Npcap-WinPcap compatilibitly](/img/install/Npcap_compatibility_mode.png)
   :::

5. [WinPcap developer's pack](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm) **OR** [Npcap SDK](https://nmap.org/npcap/guide/npcap-devguide.html) - containing the `wpcap` library PcapPlusPlus is linking with plus relevant `.h` files.
   1. WinPcap developer's pack can be downloaded from here: [https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm)
   2. Npcap SDK can be downloaded from here: [https://nmap.org/npcap/#download](https://nmap.org/npcap/#download)

## Build

Assuming you want to build PcapPlusPlus into a `build` directory:

```shell
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DPCAP_ROOT=<NpcapSDK_or_WinPcapDevPack_Directory> -S . -B build
```

And then initiate the build in one of two ways:

- Using CMake:
  ```shell
  cmake --build build
  ```
- Using `make`:
  ```shell
  cd build
  make
  ```

This process will build the following artifacts:

- PcapPlusPlus libs:
  - `build\Common++\libCommon++.a`
  - `build\Packet++\libPacket++.a`
  - `build\Pcap++\libPcap++.a`
- PcapPlusPlus examples binaries under `build\examples_bin`
- PcapPlusPlus tests:
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>\Tests\Packet++Test\Bin\Packet++Test.exe`
  - `<PcapPlusPlus_Dir>\Tests\Pcap++Test\Bin\Pcap++Test.exe`

The following configuration options are available (on top of CMake's built-in options):

| Option                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`-DPCAP_ROOT=<DIR>`**                 | Npcap SDK or WinPcap developer pack directory (mandatory option)                                                                                                                |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=<ON/OFF>`**  | Build PcapPlusPlus examples (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                             |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TESTS=<ON/OFF>`**     | Build PcapPlusPlus tests (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                                |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_TUTORIALS=<ON/OFF>`** | Build PcapPlusPlus tutorials. This option is only available if `DPCAPPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`. The tutorials binaries will be under `build\tutorials_bin` (default value is `OFF`) |
| **`-DPCAPPP_INSTALL=<ON/OFF>`**         | Install PcapPlusPlus (default value is `ON` if building the project itself, otherwise `OFF`)                                                                                    |
| **`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=<ON/OFF>`**      | Build shared libs (default value is `OFF`)                                                                                                                                      |
| **`-DPCAPPP_BUILD_PCAPPP=<ON/OFF>`**    | Build the Pcap++ library (default value is `ON`). Turning it off will only build Common++ and Packet++ and avoid third-party dependencies such as libpcap or WinPcap/Npcap      |
| **`-DPCAPPP_LOG_LEVEL=<0/1/2/3>`**      | Set compile time log level: Off (`0`), Error (`1`), Info (`2`), Debug (`1`) (Default value is `Debug`)                                                                          |

## Installation

Windows doesn't have a default install directory, but you may want to see all libs, header files and examples under one directory (which is not the `build` directory).
Here is how to acheive that:

```shell
set DESTDIR=<DIR>
cmake --install build --prefix "/"
```

## Running tests

PcapPlusPlus contains a set of test-cases you can run to make sure that everything works correctly on your system. [This guide](../tests) contains detailed instructions on how to run them.
