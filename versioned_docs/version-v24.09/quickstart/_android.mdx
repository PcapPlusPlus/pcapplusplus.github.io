[ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus) is an Android application designed for monitoring and analyzing network traffic on an Android device. It works by creating a VPN tunnel and routing all device traffic through it, allowing access to raw packets for real-time analysis and data storage.

The app is heavily inspired by Googleâ€™s [ToyVpn](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ToyVpn) example, which demonstrates how to use Android's VPN APIs to implement custom VPN solutions.

For more details, check out the [ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus's `README.md`](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus/blob/master/README.md) file, including instructions on how to [build and install the app](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus#build-and-run-instructions-%EF%B8%8F).

Pre-compiled PcapPlusPlus libraries for Android are available on the release page: <ReleaseLink/>.
