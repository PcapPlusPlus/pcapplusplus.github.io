### Step 1 - install PcapPlusPlus

Before installing PcapPlusPlus make sure you have the prerequisites installed for [MinGW-w64](./install/mingw#prerequisites-for-building-with-mingw-w64).

Pre-compiled packages are available for MinGW-w64. You can find them under the <ReleaseLink/>.

Make sure your MinGW-w64 GCC version matches the pre-compiled package. Otherwise you need to [build PcapPlusPlus from source](./install/mingw).

### Step 2 - create your first app

If you downloaded a pre-compiled package go to: `Drive:\path\to\your\package\example-app`.

If you built it from source, download the <CodeLink relativePath="/Examples/ExampleApp">ExampleApp</CodeLink> source files.

Make sure you see the following files:

```shell
 |-- main.cpp
 |-- 1_packet.pcap
 |-- CMakeLists.txt
```

`main.cpp` is the example application we'll use.

`1_packet.pcap` is a pcap file the app reads from.

`CMakeLists.txt` will help us build the app.

### Step 3 - build and run your app

Configure CMake:

```cmd
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build -DPcapPlusPlus_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\your\package -DPCAP_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\npcap-sdk -DPacket_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\npcap-sdk
```

Build the app:

```cmd
cmake --build build
```

An executable file will be created which contains the compiled app. You can now run it and should be able to see the following output:

```cmd
example-app.exe
Source IP is '10.0.0.138'; Dest IP is '10.0.0.1'
```
