### Step 1 - download PcapPlusPlus

Before downloading PcapPlusPlus make sure you have the prerequisites installed for [Linux](./install/linux#prerequisites).

Pre-compiled packages are available for recent versions of Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL and Alpine. You can find them under the <ReleaseLink/>.

Another option is using [Homebrew on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) if you have it installed on your system:

```shell
brew install pcapplusplus
```

If you have another Linux distribution or GCC version you'll need to [build PcapPlusPlus from source](./install/linux). Make sure not to skip the [installation](./install/linux#installation) part.

### Step 2 - create your first app

If you downloaded a pre-compiled package go to: `/path/to/your/package/example-app`.

If not, download the <CodeLink relativePath="/Examples/ExampleApp">ExampleApp</CodeLink> source files.

Make sure you see the following files:

```shell
 |-- main.cpp
 |-- 1_packet.pcap
 |-- CMakeLists.txt
```

`main.cpp` is the example application we'll use.

`1_packet.pcap` is a pcap file the app reads from.

`CMakeLists.txt` will help us build the app.

### Step 3 - build and run your app

Configure CMake:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -DPcapPlusPlus_ROOT=/path/to/your/package
```

Build the app:

```shell
cmake --build build
```

An executable file will be created which contains the compiled app. You can now run it and should be able to see the following output:

```shell
./example-app
Source IP is '10.0.0.138'; Dest IP is '10.0.0.1'
```
