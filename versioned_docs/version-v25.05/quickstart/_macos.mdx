### Step 1 - install PcapPlusPlus

Before installing PcapPlusPlus make sure you have the prerequisites installed for [MacOS](./install/macos#prerequisites).

The easiest way to get PcapPlusPlus is from Homebrew:

```shell
brew install pcapplusplus
```

If you prefer not to use Homebrew you can also found pre-compiled packages for various versions of Xcode in the <ReleaseLink/>.

Another option is to build PcapPlusPlus [from source](./install/macos). Make sure not to skip the [installation](./install/macos#installation) part.

### Step 2 - create your first app

If you downloaded a pre-compiled package go to: `/path/to/your/package/example-app`.

If you installed PcapPlusPlus using Homebrew or built from source, download the <CodeLink relativePath="/Examples/ExampleApp">ExampleApp</CodeLink> source files.

Make sure you see the following files:

```shell
 |-- main.cpp
 |-- 1_packet.pcap
 |-- CMakeLists.txt
```

`main.cpp` is the example application we'll use.

`1_packet.pcap` is a pcap file the app reads from.

`CMakeLists.txt` will help us build the app.

### Step 3 - build and run your app

Configure CMake:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -DPcapPlusPlus_ROOT=/path/to/your/package
```

Build the app:

```shell
cmake --build build
```

An executable file will be created which contains the compiled app. You can now run it and should be able to see the following output:

```shell
./example-app
Source IP is '10.0.0.138'; Dest IP is '10.0.0.1'
```
