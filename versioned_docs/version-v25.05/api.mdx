PcapPlusPlus consists of 3 libraries:

- **Packet++** - a library for parsing, creating and editing network packets
- **Pcap++** - a library for intercepting and sending packets, providing network and NIC info, stats, etc. It is actually a C++ wrapper for packet capturing engines such as libpcap, WinPcap, Npcap, DPDK and PF_RING
- **Common++** - a library with some common code utilities used by both Packet++ and Pcap++

The dependency model between the libraries is as follows:

<ThemedImageWithBaseUrl
  srcLight="/api-docs/libraries-light.svg"
  srcDark="/api-docs/libraries-dark.svg"
/>

That means, you can use **Common++** separately from the other libraries, and you can also use **Packet++** without **Pcap++**.

All of PcapPlusPlus APIs including classes for all of these libraries, files, data structures, etc. are documented in details using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
