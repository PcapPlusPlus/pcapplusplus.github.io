### ToyVpn

[ToyVpn](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ToyVpn) is an Android example app provided by Google that demonstrates Android APIs to create VPN solutions. You can read more about it in the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/vpn).

ToyVpn uses [`VpnService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService) to handle incoming and outgoing network traffic, which means is has access to the network packets going through the VPN (which is otherwise not possible on non-rooted devices). This makes it a great example of how PcapPlusPlus can be used in Android apps and run on any device without special requirements such as a rooted device.

### ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus

[ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus) is a version of ToyVpn that uses PcapPlusplus to gather data and metrics on the network traffic that goes through the VPN. It collects data such as packet count of different protocols (IPv4, IPv6, DNS, TLS, etc.), TCP connections, DNS requests and responses, TLS versions, TLS Server Name Indication (SNI), and more. These metrics are collected and written to the app's log. In addition to data collection, all of the network traffic is captured and saved to a pcap file that can be used for further investigation.

[ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus's `README.md`](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus/blob/v1.0.0/README.md) file contains detailed information on how to [build and install the app](https://github.com/seladb/ToyVpn-PcapPlusPlus/blob/v1.0.0#build-and-run-instructions).

PcapPlusPlus pre-compiled libraries are available in the release page: <ReleaseLink/>.

Here is a screenshot of the app:

And here is an example of the metrics collected by the app (as written to the app's log):
