Most applications that need network access (such as browsers, apps, etc.) have a unique combination(s) of these parameters while making network connections, so this technique can be used to fingerprint those applications. By using a database of curated fingerprints it's possible to detect network traffic anomalies which can point to malware, security vulnerabilities or other undesired behavior. It can also be used for network visibility, for example identify popular applications, detect applications that use weak encryption, etc. This method of fingerprinting is very effective because TLS handshake is often done in lower levels of the application hence it's difficult to forge or tamper with it."}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["The primary concept for TLS fingerprinting came from ",(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://blog.squarelemon.com/tls-fingerprinting/",children:"Lee Brotherston\u2019s 2015 research"})," (",(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/tls-fingerprinting",children:"GitHub repo"}),").
